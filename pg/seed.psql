VALUES ('The Fresh Alternative to Napa', 'Santa Rosa', 'CA', 'United States', 'Santa Rosa is a California city in Sonoma County. It's known for its many vineyards and wineries. It happens to be the furthest West one can go for ideal grape growing climate.', 'Located in the village shopping center, you‚Äôll find a variety of food‚Äôs on Monti‚Äôs menu. Ranging from Seafood, Pasta, and Primerib there is something on the menu the whole family can enjoy. Since we are in wine country, don‚Äôt hesitate to check out the wine menu and pair it with some fresh-caught crab or chilled oysters.', 'If you are lucky enough to visit in late autumn, you can enjoy the pleasures of making wine. This includes picking grapes at the right time, removing the must at the right time, monitoring and regulating fermentation, and storing the wine long enough. The wine-making process can be divided into four distinct steps: harvesting and crushing grapes; fermenting must; ageing the wine; and packaging. There are many wineries that allow you to tour their site to view this process', ' Open during the last couple of weekends in Septemeber is the Sonoma County Art Trails. A true treat to see and a testament to the talent that resides in the hills North of the Bay. You can explore their artistic sanctuaries and discover the person behind those paintings, drawings, prints and sculptures in glass, wood, bronze, stone or clay‚Ä¶ Listen to their stories and learn about the talent and skill involved to reach such beauty', 6, '2020-09-28', 'https://hrwatchdog.calchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/SonomaCounty.jpg','https://www.sonomacounty.com/sites/default/files/listing_images/profile/1452/dining_Montis_Santa_Rosa_patio_Sonoma_County_0020-886353d45056a36_886356c2-5056-a36a-079978f4b9421e00.jpg', 'https://photos.app.goo.gl/GAfqpKKSqECshLdC6', 'https://marinmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Wolfe1-1540x1155.jpg', 1);
